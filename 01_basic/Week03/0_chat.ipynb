       "Certainly. Black holes are regions of spacetime exhibiting gravitational fields so intense that nothing—not even light—can escape from within their event horizons. The creation of black holes is understood primarily through the framework of general relativity and astrophysics.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Stellar-Mass Black Holes:**\n",
       "Most commonly, black holes form from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (typically those with initial masses > 20–25 solar masses). At the end of their life cycles, such stars undergo supernova explosions after exhausting their nuclear fuel. If the remnant core's mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) limit (about 2–3 solar masses), neutron degeneracy pressure cannot halt collapse, and the core contracts into a singularity surrounded by an event horizon—a black hole.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Supermassive Black Holes:**\n",
       "These are found at the centers of most galaxies, with masses ranging from millions to billions of solar masses. Their formation remains an open question, but leading hypotheses include the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe, mergers of many smaller black holes, or rapid accretion processes.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Primordial Black Holes:**\n",
       "A speculative class, these could have formed in the early universe from density fluctuations soon after the Big Bang, long before stars existed. They remain hypothetical, but are of interest in studies of dark matter and early-universe cosmology.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Other Formation Channels:**\n",
       "- **Black Hole Mergers:** The coalescence of two black holes (detected via gravitational waves, e.g., by LIGO/Virgo) results in a more massive black hole.\n",
       "- **Accretion-Induced Collapse:** Neutron stars in binary systems that accrete enough mass may collapse into black holes.\n",
       "- **Runaway Stellar Mergers:** In dense star clusters, repeated stellar collisions can produce sufficiently massive stars that collapse into intermediate-mass black holes.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Theoretical Concepts:**\n",
       "- **Event Horizon:** The boundary beyond which escape velocity exceeds the speed of light.\n",
       "- **Singularity:** The point (or region) of infinite density at black hole centers (as predicted by classical general relativity).\n",
       "- **No-Hair Theorem:** Black holes are characterized externally only by mass, charge, and angular momentum.\n",
